# telegram_ai_bot

Python script that implements a bot for searching the internet for plants and gardening information. It generates data embeddings of search results and accepts requests from a Telegram bot or webhook. The script uses the Flask web framework to handle incoming requests and the Telegram Bot API to interact with users. It defines several functions for handling different types of requests, such as starting the bot, setting the user's location, handling messages, and handling custom updates. The script also uses an embedding_search module to perform searches and generate completions based on the user's input. Finally, the script sets up a web server using the Uvicorn ASGI server and runs the application.
